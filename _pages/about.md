I'm Mitch, a PhD student in the Department of Engineering Education and a master's student in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. Previously, I earned a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and worked as a software engineer for the automotive industry before returning to graduate school.

My research explores what it means to develop engineering expertise in an era shaped by generative artificial intelligence (gen-AI). I am particularly interested in how gen-AI tools are transforming the ways engineers learn, solve problems, and construct knowledge—especially at the graduate level. My work asks how these technologies can be thoughtfully integrated into engineering education to enhance learning and practice, while also considering the ethical, epistemic, and practical challenges they introduce.

More broadly, I study how graduate students and faculty in STEM fields recognize, negotiate, and develop the ways of knowing and doing that define their disciplines. I am fascinated by the long-term implications of these evolving practices for the future of engineering knowledge, expertise, and education.
