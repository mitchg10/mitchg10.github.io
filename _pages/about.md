Hi! I'm Mitch. I'm a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Engineering Education at Virginia Tech and simultaneous master's student in Computer Science. I earned his B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Virginia Tech and worked as a software engineer for General Motors in Detroit, Michigan, before returning to graduate school. My research focuses on engineering expertise and generative artificial intelligence (GAI); in particular, how GAI is transforming the way engineering expertise is developed, displayed, recognized, and trusted. My current research examines the use of GAI for qualitative research methods, STEM graduate students’ GAI utilization, and how STEM higher education instructors negotiate and uphold “academic integrity” amid widespread GAI use.

If you’re interested in the intersection of engineering, education, and emerging technologies, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
